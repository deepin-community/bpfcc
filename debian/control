Description: shared library for BPF Compiler Collection (BCC)
 BPF Compiler Collection (BCC) is a toolkit for creating efficient
 kernel tracing and manipulation programs
 .
 It makes use of extended BPF (Berkeley Package Filter) and provides tools
 for BPF based Linux IO analysis, networking, monitoring and more
 .
 This package provides the shared library for BPF Compiler Collection
 to control BPF programs from userspace.

Description: tools for BPF Compiler Collection based on libbpf (BTF and CO-RE)
 BPF Compiler Collection (BCC) is a toolkit for creating efficient
 kernel tracing and manipulation programs
 .
 It makes use of extended BPF (Berkeley Package Filter) and provides tools
 for BPF based Linux IO analysis, networking, monitoring and more
 .
 This package provides the tools from bpfcc-tools but written in a portable
 fashion using BTF and libbpf hence the installation footprint will be smaller
 compared to bpfcc-tools.
 .
 At this time this package contains subset of tools from bpfcc-tools
